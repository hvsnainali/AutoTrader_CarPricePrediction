# Machine Learning for Car Sale Adverts

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning solution for predicting the selling prices of cars based on their characteristics. The project is part of the Machine Learning Concepts unit, providing students with a real-world, industry-based problem-solving experience.

## Project Tasks

- **Data Understanding, Exploration, Cleaning, and Preparation:**
  - Analyze the Car Sale Adverts dataset provided by AutoTrader.
  - Explore and understand the features, including brand, type, color, mileage, and selling price.
  - Clean the data, handle missing values, and prepare it for machine learning tasks.

- **Machine Learning Model Development:**
  - Select and implement appropriate machine learning models for regression.
  - Tune and optimize the selected models for better performance.
  - Fit the models to the training data and evaluate their performance.

- **Report and Documentation:**
  - Produce a structured report documenting the entire machine learning process.
  - Include code snippets and explanations for each step.
  - Highlight insights gained from the analysis and model evaluation.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a Car Sale Adverts dataset provided by AutoTrader, containing anonymized information about vehicles, including brand, type, color, mileage, and selling price. The goal is to build a regression model that accurately predicts the selling price based on these features.

## Deliverables

- A brief, structured report with code snippets and explanations.
- A fully-documented, reproducible Python notebook showcasing the work undertaken.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis and reproduce the results, follow the instructions provided in the Python notebook.

## Acknowledgments
